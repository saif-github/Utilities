	step 2 : make the script operational by using command
		chmod +x list_c.sh

	step 3 : execute the script 
		./list_c.sh

		source ~/.bashrc

	step 4 : use ls -a or alias mentioned in bash sample script to verify in home directory.
		ls -a
		la

13. To get a list of presently exported environment variables,
	env
    To get the complete set of variables.
	set
    To display any ENV

	Step 6:  
		source ~/.bashrc 
		
   To set system wide ENVs
	Step 1: Open the terminal. 
	Step 2: 
		sudo -H vi /etc/environment

	Step 3:Enter password. 
	Step 4:Add variable in the file opened.

   Some commonly used ENVs in Linux

	$USER: Gives current user's name.
	$PATH: Gives search path for commands.
	$PWD: Gives the path of present working directory.
	$HOME: Gives path of home directory.
	$HOSTNAME: Gives name of the host.
	$LANG: Gives the default system language.
	$EDITOR: Gives default file editor.
	$UID: Gives user ID of current user.
	$SHELL: Gives location of current user's shell program.

   unset environment variables
	unset NAME
	or
	NAME=''
	or
	export -n NAME

   An environment variable must be exported to propagate its value to a child process.
	VAR=value ; export VAR
	export VAR=value

   You can also make one or more environment variables take effect for just one command:
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD DEBUG=3 ./foobar

14. Customizing the Command Line Prompt

Customizing the command line prompt is as simple as modifying the value of the environment variable PS1. 
For example, to set it to display the hostname, user and current directory:  PS1="\h:\u:\w>"
