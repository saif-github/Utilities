Linux command line Basics :-


1. To become root
   sudo -i

2. To find the user part of which all groups
   groups saif
   saif : saif adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare

3. to add user to sudoers list 
   usermod -aG sudo saif

4. Exit root mode
   exit

5. To view the hidden files in linux directories
   ls -a

6. List all the c program files in PWD
   find . -name "*.c" -ls
   Ex : find /proj/PICTOR/workspace/Saif_ub/QLCPROTO/ -name create_hs.sh\

7. list and scales file sizes and directory sizes into KB, MB, GB, or TB when the file or directory size is larger than 1024 bytes.
   ls -l -h

8. Create files using Cat command

	cat << EOF > file1.txt
	Some line
	Some other line
	EOF

9. Create files using echo command
	echo line one > myfile
	echo line two >> myfile
	echo line three >> myfile

10. Create a bash script with .sh extention
	step 1 : Example script to find all the C programs files (list_c.sh)
		#!/bin/bash
		find . -name "*.c" -ls

	step 2 : make the script operational by using command
		chmod +x list_c.sh

	step 3 : execute the script 
		./list_c.sh

11. To check shells scripts supported in current linux distro
    cat /etc/shells

	/bin/sh
	/bin/dash
	/bin/bash
	/bin/rbash

12. Create and enable .bashrc or .bash_profile
	step 1 : Open terminal and enter
		touch ~/.bashrc

	step 2 : To edit the file use - use sample bashrc to begin 
		nano ~/.bashrc

	step 3 : To immediately enable the changes in .bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc

	step 4 : use ls -a or alias mentioned in bash sample script to verify in home directory.
		ls -a
		la

13. To get a list of presently exported environment variables,
	env
    To get the complete set of variables.
	set
    To display any ENV
	echo $NAME
    To set user wide ENVs
	Step 1: Open the terminal. 
	Step 2: 
		sudo vi ~/.bashrc

	Step 3:Enter password. 
	Step 4:Add variable in the file opened.  

	export NAME=Value

	Step 5: Save and close the file. 
	Step 6:  
		source ~/.bashrc 
		
   To set system wide ENVs
	Step 1: Open the terminal. 
	Step 2: 
		sudo -H vi /etc/environment

	Step 3:Enter password. 
	Step 4:Add variable in the file opened.  

	NAME=Value

	Step 5: Save and close the file. 
	Step 6: Logout and Login again. 

   Some commonly used ENVs in Linux

	$USER: Gives current user's name.
	$PATH: Gives search path for commands.
	$PWD: Gives the path of present working directory.
	$HOME: Gives path of home directory.
	$HOSTNAME: Gives name of the host.
	$LANG: Gives the default system language.
	$EDITOR: Gives default file editor.
	$UID: Gives user ID of current user.
	$SHELL: Gives location of current user's shell program.

   unset environment variables
	unset NAME
	or
	NAME=''
	or
	export -n NAME

   An environment variable must be exported to propagate its value to a child process.
	VAR=value ; export VAR
	export VAR=value

   You can also make one or more environment variables take effect for just one command:
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD DEBUG=3 ./foobar

14. Customizing the Command Line Prompt

	Customizing the command line prompt is as simple as modifying the value of the environment variable PS1. 
	For example, to set it to display the hostname, user and current directory:  PS1="\h:\u:\w>"

	hylcufsdev06:sbaig:/proj/PICTOR/workspace/sbaig/QLCPROTO>

15. list all the alias avalable to user

	alias

16. Find the file in directory and print on console

	find . -type f -name "HAL_CMDT_N48R.h" -print

17. Find the string recursively in files in current director

	grep -r string *

18. Find the string in file passed

	grep -irn string test.sh

19. Many basic commands and utilities are the same in Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems. While there may be some variation in some of the options and syntax, the purpose remains the same. Here are lists of these commands grouped by general area of coverage:

File Compression
bunzip2, bzcat, bdiff, bzip2, bzless 
gunzip, gzexe, gzip, zcat, zless 
zip, upzip
xz, unxz, xzcat

File Ownership, Permissions and Attributes
attr, chgrp, chown, chmod

Files
awk, basename, cat, col, cp, cpio, csplit, cut, dd, diff, dirname, egrep, expand, file, fgrep, fmt, grep, head, join, less, more, sed, tail, tar

Filesystem
cd, chroot, df, dirs, du, fdisk, fsck, fuser, ln, ls, mkdir, mv, pushd, popd, rm, rmdir 

Networking

Job Control
at, atrm, batch, crontab, exec, exit, ipcs, ipcrm, kill, killall

Expression Evaluation

There are many other commands and utilities that could be added to this list.


20 . systemd service units

systemctl start name   --> Starts a service

systemctl stop name  --> Stops a service

systemctl restart name --> Restarts a service

systemctl status name --> Checks whether a service is running

systemctl status name --> Checks whether a service is running

Ex : systemctl status sshd

21 . to watch kernel messages      

sudo tail -f /var/log/messages
dmesg -w

22. Basic information about active network interfaces on your system is gathered through both the ip utility,

ip -s link
/sbin/ifconfig

23. Network traffic bound to the machine.

Note you can see the statistical information in abbreviated form by looking at /proc/net/dev, 
and in one quantity per line display in /sys/class/net/eth0/statistics

ex: ls -l /sys/class/net/enp1s0/statistics/

24.  Networking and Network Interfaces (Cont.)
To bring a network connection up and assign a static address, you can do:sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up 192.168.1.100
To bring it up and get it an assigned address from a DHCP server, you can do:
sudo /sbin/dhclient eth0
While ifconfig has been used reliably for many years, the ip utility is newer (and far more versatile). On a technical level, it is more efficient because it uses netlink sockets, rather than ioctl system calls.
ip can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It can be used to display and control devices, routing, policy-based routing, and tunneling. The basic syntax is:
ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

Some examples:
Show information for all network interfaces: ip link

Show information for the eth0 network interface:
ip -s link show eth0

Set the IP address for eth0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.7 dev eth0

Bring eth0 down:
sudo ip link set eth0 down

Set the MTU to 1480 bytes for eth0
sudo ip link set eth0 mtu 1480

Set the networking route:
sudo ip route add 172.16.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.5

25. Static Configuration of a Network Interface

ip addr show eth0
sudo ip link set eth0 down 
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100 dev eth0 
sudo ip link set eth0 up
sudo ip link set eth0 up 
sudo dhclient eth0
sudo reboot

26. Process and Load Monitoring Utilities

top  --> Process activity, dynamically updated

uptime --> How long the system is running and the average load

ps  --> Detailed information about processes

pstree --> A tree of processes and their connections

mpstat --> Multiple processor usage

iostat  --> CPU utilization and I/O statistics

sar --> Display and collect information about system activity

numastat  --> Information about NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Architecture)

strace --> Information about all system calls a process makes

You can simply run a command with strace like this, here we are tracing of all system calls made by the df command.

strace df -h


27. Memory Monitoring Utilities
free --> Brief summary of memory usage

vmstat --> Detailed virtual memory statistics and block I/O, dynamically updated

pmap  --> Process memory map


28.
I/O Monitoring Utilities

iostat --> CPU utilization and I/O statistics

iotop --> I/O statistics including per process

sar --> Display and collect information about system activity

vmstat --> Detailed virtual memory statistics and block I/O, dynamically updated
