# on Ubuntu Linux 16.04, the version of vim is vim-tiny. The purpose is to provide the vi command for base Linux installations
# it contains a minimal version of Vim (compiled with no GUI) and a minimal subset of features (for a small package size)
# to install a full-blown Vim package:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim

# usage:  vi [ARGUMENT]... [FILE]...

# you can find help on the web if it's not installed (as in a base Ubuntu OS deployment)

# Vim is composed mainly of two modes: visual and editing, the visual mode is for viewing text and using commands
# to enter editing mode, press 'i' to insert and 'a' to append
# to return to visual mode and access all the menu-type functions, press the “Escape” key
# to move the cursor within the body of the file (whether in visual or editing mode), you can use the keyboard arrows
# you can also use the h,j,k,and l keys: h is left, l is right, k is up, j is down
# you can type a number before any of these commands and it will be executed that number of times
# eg: 5x will delete five consecutive characters and 5p will paste three times
# Common visual mode commands
• x        - delete a character
• u        - undo an action (the equivalent of Ctrl+z)
• dd       - delete a line
• dw       - delete a word
• yy       - copy a line
• yw       - copy a word
• p        - paste the previously deleted or copied line or word
• e        - move to the next word (faster than just moving with the arrow keys)
• r        - replace a letter (press r, then the new letter)

# you can navigate by jumping to a specific location within a file
# you can type a number before any of these commands and it will be executed that number of times
# eg: 5x will delete five consecutive characters and 5p will paste three times
• G        - to jump to the end of a file use G
• gg       - to jump to the beginning of a file use gg
• 5gg      - to go to the specific line in a file where 'n' is the line number eg: 100gg lands the cursor on line 100

# for searching the open file:
• /pattern   - search forward for pattern
• ?pattern   - search backward
• n          - repeat forward search
• N          - repeat backward
• *          - search for word currently under cursor

# very useful search and replace:
• :%s/search_for_this/replace_with_this/    - search whole file and replace
• :%s/search_for_this/replace_with_this/c   - confirm each replace


The basic steps to perform a search in Vim are as follows:
Press /.
Type the search pattern.
Press Enter to perform the search.
Press n to find the next occurrence or N to find the previous occurrence.
